    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Simple and easy homeade bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2-1/4 tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
                <li>2-1/4 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 T salt</li>
                <li>2 T oil</li>
                <li>5-1/2 to 6-1/2 cups bread flour</li>
                <li>butter for topping</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, dissolve the yeast in the warm water with a pinch of sugar. When the yeast is bubbly and foamy, add the sugar, salt, oil, and 4 cups flour, and mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Add remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, to form a soft, smooth dough. The dough should stick just slightly to your finger when touched, but not be overly sticky. Knead 5-7 minutes, until smooth, then roll into a ball.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, turn over once to coat the top with oil and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise one hour, or until doubled.</li>
                <li>When the dough has risen, punch it down gently and divide in half. Roll each half of the dough into a long rectangle about 8 inches wide. Roll the dough up, starting at the short edge, to form a cylinder that is approximately 8 inches wide. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
                <li>Place the dough, seam side down, into lightly greased bread pans, and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise one hour, or until the dough is ½ - 1 inch higher than the top of the pan.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375. Bake 30-35 minutes, or the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Brush with melted butter, if desired. Remove to a cooling rack and cool before slicing. MAKES 2 LOAVES.</li>
